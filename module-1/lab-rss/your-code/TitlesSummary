In recent posts, we described requisite <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies"">foundational technologies</a> needed to sustain machine learning practices within organizations, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations"">specialized tools</a> for model development, model governance, and model operations/testing/monitoring.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What cultural and organizational changes will be needed to accommodate the rise of machine and learning and AI? In this post, we\'ll address this question through the lens of one highly regulated industry: financial services. Financial services firms have a rich tradition of being early adopters of many new technologies, and AI is no exception:</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=""center"" id=""id-6YOix""><img alt=""Stage of adoption of AI technologies"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-4498eaf55b7905f15ae962b3d63d54ae.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 1. </span><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">Stage of adoption of AI technologies</a> (by industry). Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside health care, another heavily regulated sector, financial services companies have historically had to build in explainability and transparency to some of their algorithms (e.g., <a href=""https://www.debt.org/credit/your-consumer-rights/fair-credit-reporting-act/"">credit scores</a>). In our experience, many of the most popular conference talks on model explainability and interpretability are those given by speakers from finance.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=""center"" id=""id-RlWiz""><img alt=""AI projects in financial services and health care"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-d71740e0aef3aa8728d3fd2e0048119c.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 2. </span><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">AI projects in financial services and health care</a>. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve issued a new set of guidelines governing models—<a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm"">SR 11-7</a>: <em>Guidance on Model Risk Management</em>. The goal of SR 11-7 was to broaden a set of earlier guidelines which focused mainly on model validation. While there aren’t any surprising things in SR 11-7, it pulls together important considerations that arise once an organization starts using models to power important products and services. In the remainder of this post, we\'ll list the key areas and recommendations covered in SR 11-7, and explain how they are relevant to recent developments in machine learning. (Note that the emphasis of SR 11-7 is on <em>risk management</em>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sources of model risk</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We should clarify that SR 11-7 also covers models that aren’t necessarily based on machine learning: ""quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates."" With this in mind, there are many potential sources of model risk, SR 11-7 highlighted incorrect or inappropriate use of models, and fundamental errors. Machine learning developers are beginning to look at an even broader set of risk factors. In <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning"">earlier posts</a>, we listed things ML engineers and data scientists may have to manage, such as bias, privacy, security (including <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure"">attacks aimed against models</a>), explainability, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies"">safety and reliability</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=""center"" id=""id-5meiz""><img alt=""Model risk management"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3_2-fe131cc4a1a96995987b4b609f77eef3.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 3. </span>Model risk management. Image by Ben Lorica and Harish Doddi.</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Model development and implementation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of SR 11-7 emphasize the importance of having a clear statement of purpose so models are aligned with their intended use. This is consistent with something ML developers have long known: models built and trained for a specific application are <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care"">seldom (off-the-shelf) usable</a> in other settings. Regulators behind SR 11-7 also emphasize the importance of data—specifically data <em>quality</em>, <em>relevance</em>, and <em>documentation</em>. While models garner the most press coverage, the reality is that <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">data remains the main bottleneck</a> in most ML projects. With these important considerations in mind, research organizations and startups are building tools focused on data <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data"">quality</a>, <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies"">governance, and lineage</a>. Developers are also building tools that enable model reproducibility, collaboration, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">partial automation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Model validation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SR 11-7 has some specific organizational suggestions for how to approach model validation. The fundamental principle it advances is that organizations need to enable critical analysis by competent teams that are able to identify the limitations of proposed models. First, model validation teams should be comprised of people who weren’t responsible for the development of a model. This is similar to recommendations made in <a href=""https://www.immuta.com/beyond-explainability-a-practical-guide-to-managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models/"">a recent report</a> released by The Future of Privacy Forum and Immuta (their report is specifically focused on ML). Second, given the tendency to showcase and reward the work of model builders <em>over</em> those of model validators, appropriate authority, incentives, and compensation policies should be in place to reward teams that perform model validation. In particular, SR 11-7 introduces the notion of ""effective challenge"":</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Staff conducting validation work should have explicit authority to challenge developers and users, and to elevate their findings, including issues and deficiencies. ... Effective challenge depends on a combination of incentives, competence, and influence.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, SR 11-7 recommends that there be processes in place to select and validate models developed by third-parties. Given the rise of SaaS and the proliferation of open source research prototypes, this is an issue that is very relevant to organizations that use machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Model monitoring</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a model is deployed to production, SR 11-7 authors emphasize the importance of having monitoring tools and targeted reports aimed at decision-makers. This is in line with <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations"">our recent recommendation</a> that ML operations teams provide dashboards with custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, and business owners). They also cite another important reason to setup <em>independent</em> risk monitoring teams: the authors point out that in some instances, the incentive to challenge specific models might be asymmetric. Depending on the reward structure within an organization, some parties might be less likely to challenge models that help elevate their own specific key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Governance, policies, controls</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>SR 11-7 highlights the importance of maintaining a model catalog that contains complete information for all models, including those currently deployed, recently retired, and under development. The authors also emphasize that documentation should be detailed enough so that “parties unfamiliar with a model can understand how the model operates, its limitations, and its key assumptions.” These are relevant to ML, and the early tools and open source projects <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential"">for ML lifecycle development and model governance</a> will need to be supplemented with tools that facilitate the creation of adequate documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This section of SR 11-7 also has specific recommendations on roles that might be useful for organizations that are beginning to use more ML in products and services:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<strong>Model owners</strong> make sure that models are properly developed, implemented, and used. In the ML world, these are data scientists, machine learning engineers, or other specialists.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<strong>Risk-control staff</strong> take care of risk measurement, limits, monitoring, and independent validation. In the ML context, this would be a separate team of domain experts, data scientists, and ML engineers.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<strong>Compliance staff</strong> ensure there are specific processes in place for model owners and risk-control staff.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<strong>External regulators</strong> are responsible for making sure these measures are being properly followed across all the business units.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aggregate exposure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been many examples of seemingly well-prepared financial institutions caught off-guard by rogue units or rogue traders who weren’t properly accounted for in risk models. To that end, SR 11-7 recommends that financial institutions consider risk from <em>individual</em> models as well as <em>aggregate</em> risks that stem from model interactions and dependencies. Many ML teams have not started to think of tools and processes for managing risks stemming from the simultaneous deployment of multiple models, but it’s clear that many applications will require this sort of planning and thinking. Creators of emerging applications that depend on many different data sources, pipelines, and models (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart buildings, and smart cities) will need to manage risks in the aggregate. New digital-native companies (in media, e-commerce, finance, etc.) that rely very heavily on data and machine learning also need systems to <a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/video323441.html"">monitor many machine learning models individually and in aggregate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Health care and other industries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While we focused this post in guidelines written specifically for financial institutions, companies in every industry will need to develop tools and processes for model risk management. Many companies are already affected by existing (<a href=""https://eugdpr.org/"">GDPR</a>) and forthcoming (<a href=""https://www.caprivacy.org/"">CCPA</a>) privacy regulations. And, as mentioned, ML teams are beginning to build tools to help detect bias, protect privacy, protect against <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure"">attacks aimed at models</a>, and ensure model <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies"">safety and reliability</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Health care is another highly regulated industry that AI is rapidly changing. Earlier this year, the U.S. FDA took a big step forward by publishing a <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/122535/download"">Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to AI/ML Based Software as a Medical Device</a>. The document starts by stating that “the traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive AI/ML technologies, which have the potential to adapt and optimize device performance in real time to continuously improve health care for patients.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The document goes on to propose a framework for risk management and best practices for evolving such ML/AI based systems. As a first step, the authors list modifications that impact users and thus need to be managed:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>modifications to analytical performance (i.e., model re-training)</li>\r\n\t<li>changes to the software’s inputs</li>\r\n\t<li>changes to its intended use.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The FDA proposes a total product lifecycle approach that requires different regulatory approvals. For the initial system, a premarket assurance of safety and effectiveness is required. For real-time performance, monitoring is required—along with logging, tracking, and other processes supporting a culture of quality—but not regulatory approval of every change.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This regulatory framework is new and was published in order to receive comments from the public before a full implementation. It still lacks requirements for localized measurement of safety and effectiveness, as well as for the evaluation and elimination of bias. However, it’s an important first step for developing a fast-growing AI industry for health care and biotech with a clear regulatory framework, and we recommend that practitioners stay educated on it as it evolves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every important new wave of technologies brings benefits and challenges. Managing risks in machine learning is something organizations will increasingly need to grapple with. SR 11-7 from the Federal Reserve contains many recommendations and guidelines that map well over to the needs of companies that are integrating machine learning into products and services.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning"">“Managing risk in machine learning”</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations"">“What are model governance and model operations?”</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies"">“Becoming a machine learning company means investing in foundational technologies”</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data"">“The quest for high-quality data”</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Andrew Burt and Steven Touw on <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models"">how companies can manage models they cannot fully explain</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>David Talby: <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services"">“Lessons learned turning machine learning models into real products and services”</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>Ira Cohen: <a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441"">“Applying machine learning for insights into machine learning algorithms”</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure"">“You created a machine learning application.

<p>What cultural and organizational changes will be needed to accommodate the rise of machine and learning and AI? In this post, we'll address this question through the lens of one highly regulated industry: financial services. Financial services firms have a rich tradition of being early adopters of many new technologies, and AI is no exception:</p>

<figure class=""center"" id=""id-6YOix""><img alt=""Stage of adoption of AI technologies"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-4498eaf55b7905f15ae962b3d63d54ae.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 1. </span><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">Stage of adoption of AI technologies</a> (by industry). Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>





<p>Alongside health care, another heavily regulated sector, financial services companies have historically had to build in explainability and transparency to some of their algorithms (e.g., <a href=""https://www.debt.org/credit/your-consumer-rights/fair-credit-reporting-act/"">credit scores</a>). In our experience, many of the most popular conference talks on model explainability and interpretability are those given by speakers from finance.</p>



<figure class=""center"" id=""id-RlWiz""><img alt=""AI projects in financial services and health care"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-d71740e0aef3aa8728d3fd2e0048119c.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 2. </span><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">AI projects in financial services and health care</a>.

<p>After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve issued a new set of guidelines governing models—<a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm"">SR 11-7</a>: <em>Guidance on Model Risk Management</em>. The goal of SR 11-7 was to broaden a set of earlier guidelines which focused mainly on model validation. While there aren’t any surprising things in SR 11-7, it pulls together important considerations that arise once an organization starts using models to power important products and services. In the remainder of this post, we'll list the key areas and recommendations covered in SR 11-7, and explain how they are relevant to recent developments in machine learning. (Note that the emphasis of SR 11-7 is on <em>risk management</em>.)</p>

<h2>Sources of model risk</h2>

<p>We should clarify that SR 11-7 also covers models that aren’t necessarily based on machine learning: ""quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates."" With this in mind, there are many potential sources of model risk, SR 11-7 highlighted incorrect or inappropriate use of models, and fundamental errors. Machine learning developers are beginning to look at an even broader set of risk factors. In <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning"">earlier posts</a>, we listed things ML engineers and data scientists may have to manage, such as bias, privacy, security (including <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure"">attacks aimed against models</a>), explainability, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies"">safety and reliability</a>.</p>

<h2>Model development and implementation</h2>

<p>The authors of SR 11-7 emphasize the importance of having a clear statement of purpose so models are aligned with their intended use. This is consistent with something ML developers have long known: models built and trained for a specific application are <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care"">seldom (off-the-shelf) usable</a> in other settings. Regulators behind SR 11-7 also emphasize the importance of data—specifically data <em>quality</em>, <em>relevance</em>, and <em>documentation</em>. While models garner the most press coverage, the reality is that <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">data remains the main bottleneck</a> in most ML projects. With these important considerations in mind, research organizations and startups are building tools focused on data <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data"">quality</a>, <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies"">governance, and lineage</a>. Developers are also building tools that enable model reproducibility, collaboration, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">partial automation</a>.</p>

<h2>Model validation</h2>

<p>SR 11-7 has some specific organizational suggestions for how to approach model validation. The fundamental principle it advances is that organizations need to enable critical analysis by competent teams that are able to identify the limitations of proposed models. First, model validation teams should be comprised of people who weren’t responsible for the development of a model. This is similar to recommendations made in <a href=""https://www.immuta.com/beyond-explainability-a-practical-guide-to-managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models/"">a recent report</a> released by The Future of Privacy Forum and Immuta (their report is specifically focused on ML). Second, given the tendency to showcase and reward the work of model builders <em>over</em> those of model validators, appropriate authority, incentives, and compensation policies should be in place to reward teams that perform model validation. In particular, SR 11-7 introduces the notion of ""effective challenge"":</p>



<blockquote><p>Staff conducting validation work should have explicit authority to challenge developers and users, and to elevate their findings, including issues and deficiencies. ... Effective challenge depends on a combination of incentives, competence, and influence.</p></blockquote>



<p>Finally, SR 11-7 recommends that there be processes in place to select and validate models developed by third-parties. Given the rise of SaaS and the proliferation of open source research prototypes, this is an issue that is very relevant to organizations that use machine learning.</p>

<h2>Model monitoring</h2>

<p>Once a model is deployed to production, SR 11-7 authors emphasize the importance of having monitoring tools and targeted reports aimed at decision-makers. This is in line with <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations"">our recent recommendation</a> that ML operations teams provide dashboards with custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, and business owners). They also cite another important reason to setup <em>independent</em> risk monitoring teams: the authors point out that in some instances, the incentive to challenge specific models might be asymmetric. Depending on the reward structure within an organization, some parties might be less likely to challenge models that help elevate their own specific key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>

<h2>Governance, policies, controls</h2>

<p>SR 11-7 highlights the importance of maintaining a model catalog that contains complete information for all models, including those currently deployed, recently retired, and under development. The authors also emphasize that documentation should be detailed enough so that “parties unfamiliar with a model can understand how the model operates, its limitations, and its key assumptions.” These are relevant to ML, and the early tools and open source projects <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential"">for ML lifecycle development and model governance</a> will need to be supplemented with tools that facilitate the creation of adequate documentation.</p>



<p>This section of SR 11-7 also has specific recommendations on roles that might be useful for organizations that are beginning to use more ML in products and services:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<strong>Model owners</strong> make sure that models are properly developed, implemented, and used. In the ML world, these are data scientists, machine learning engineers, or other specialists.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Risk-control staff</strong> take care of risk measurement, limits, monitoring, and independent validation. In the ML context, this would be a separate team of domain experts, data scientists, and ML engineers.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Compliance staff</strong> ensure there are specific processes in place for model owners and risk-control staff.</li>
	<li>
<strong>External regulators</strong> are responsible for making sure these measures are being properly followed across all the business units.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aggregate exposure</h2>

<p>There have been many examples of seemingly well-prepared financial institutions caught off-guard by rogue units or rogue traders who weren’t properly accounted for in risk models. To that end, SR 11-7 recommends that financial institutions consider risk from <em>individual</em> models as well as <em>aggregate</em> risks that stem from model interactions and dependencies. Many ML teams have not started to think of tools and processes for managing risks stemming from the simultaneous deployment of multiple models, but it’s clear that many applications will require this sort of planning and thinking. Creators of emerging applications that depend on many different data sources, pipelines, and models (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart buildings, and smart cities) will need to manage risks in the aggregate. New digital-native companies (in media, e-commerce, finance, etc.) that rely very heavily on data and machine learning also need systems to <a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/video323441.html"">monitor many machine learning models individually and in aggregate</a>.</p>

<h2>Health care and other industries</h2>

<p>While we focused this post in guidelines written specifically for financial institutions, companies in every industry will need to develop tools and processes for model risk management. Many companies are already affected by existing (<a href=""https://eugdpr.org/"">GDPR</a>) and forthcoming (<a href=""https://www.caprivacy.org/"">CCPA</a>) privacy regulations. And, as mentioned, ML teams are beginning to build tools to help detect bias, protect privacy, protect against <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/you-created-a-machine-learning-application-now-make-sure-its-secure"">attacks aimed at models</a>, and ensure model <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies"">safety and reliability</a>.</p>



<p>Health care is another highly regulated industry that AI is rapidly changing. Earlier this year, the U.S. FDA took a big step forward by publishing a <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/122535/download"">Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to AI/ML Based Software as a Medical Device</a>. The document starts by stating that “the traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive AI/ML technologies, which have the potential to adapt and optimize device performance in real time to continuously improve health care for patients.”</p>



<p>The document goes on to propose a framework for risk management and best practices for evolving such ML/AI based systems. As a first step, the authors list modifications that impact users and thus need to be managed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>modifications to analytical performance (i.e., model re-training)</li>
	<li>changes to the software’s inputs</li>
	<li>changes to its intended use.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FDA proposes a total product lifecycle approach that requires different regulatory approvals. For the initial system, a premarket assurance of safety and effectiveness is required. For real-time performance, monitoring is required—along with logging, tracking, and other processes supporting a culture of quality—but not regulatory approval of every change.</p>



<p>This regulatory framework is new and was published in order to receive comments from the public before a full implementation. It still lacks requirements for localized measurement of safety and effectiveness, as well as for the evaluation and elimination of bias. However, it’s an important first step for developing a fast-growing AI industry for health care and biotech with a clear regulatory framework, and we recommend that practitioners stay educated on it as it evolves.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Every important new wave of technologies brings benefits and challenges. Managing risks in machine learning is something organizations will increasingly need to grapple with. SR 11-7 from the Federal Reserve contains many recommendations and guidelines that map well over to the needs of companies that are integrating machine learning into products and services.</p>

This includes things like data quality, personalization, customer service, and many other factors that impact customer experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""center"" id=""id-5vyir""><img alt=""Areas where AI is being applied"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-a799ba5208627f24a4938c0abfcc526a.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 2. </span><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">Areas where AI is being applied</a> (by stage of adoption). Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One area I’m particularly interested in is the application of AI and automation technologies in data science, data engineering, and software development. <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development"">We’ve sketched some initial manifestations</a> of “human in the loop” technologies in software development, where initial applications of machine learning are beginning to change how people build and manage software systems. Automation has also emerged as one of the hottest topics in data science and machine learning (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning"">AutoML</a>), and teams of researchers and practitioners are actively building tools that can <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">automate every stage of a machine learning pipeline</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a typical data scientist, data engineer, or developer, there is an explosion of tools and APIs they now need to work with and “master.” A data scientist might need to know Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, one or more deep learning frameworks, Apache Spark, and more. <a href=""https://www.dev-diaries.com/blog/im-just-good-at-googling-things/"">According to a recent blog post by Khaliq Gant</a>, a web developer is typically expected to demonstrate competence in things like ""navigating the terminal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cloud infrastructure, deployment strategies, databases, HTTP protocols, and that’s just the beginning."" Data engineers additionally need to master several pieces of infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>How do data scientists, data engineers, and developers cope with this explosion of tools and APIs? They typically use <em>search</em> (Google) or post in <em>forums</em> (Stack Overflow, Slack, mailing lists). In both instances, it takes some baseline knowledge to both frame a question and to be able to discern which answer is the ""best one"" to choose. In the case of forums, there might be a significant delay before one obtains an adequate response. Those with more resources and more time to spare can avail of free or paid learning resources such as books, videos, or training courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are emerging automation tools that can drastically increase the efficiency and productivity of software developers. At his recent <a href=""https://ai.oreilly.com.cn/ai-cn/public/schedule/detail/76617?locale=en"">keynote</a> at the <a href=""https://ai.oreilly.com.cn/ai-cn?locale=en"">Artificial Intelligence conference in Beijing</a>, professor Ion Stoica, director of <a href=""https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/"">UC Berkeley’s RISELab</a>, unveiled a new research project that hints at a path forward for software developers. Their initial output is <a href=""http://AutoPandas.io"">AutoPandas</a>, a <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf"">program synthesis</a> engine for <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/"">Pandas</a>, one of the most widely used data science libraries today. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf"">As described in a paper from Microsoft and the University of Washington</a>, program synthesis is a longstanding research area in computer science:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Program synthesis is the task of automatically finding a program in the underlying programming language that satisfies the user intent expressed in the form of some specification. Since the inception of AI in the 1950s, this problem has been considered the holy grail of computer science.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An AutoPandas user simply specifies an input and output data structure (i.e., dataframes), and AutoPandas automatically synthesizes an optimal program that produces the desired output from the given input. AutoPandas relies on ""program generators"" that capture the API constraints to reduce the search space (the space of possible programs is immense), neural network models to predict the arguments of the API calls, and the distributed computing framework <a href=""https://github.com/ray-project/ray"">Ray</a> to scale up the search.</p>\n\n<figure class=""center"" id=""id-RBQi8""><img alt=""An AutoPandas user specifies an input and output data structure, and neural-backed generators output an optimal program"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-1904491123bb816831a7e8a737627c0c.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 3. </span>An AutoPandas user specifies an input and output data structure, and neural-backed generators output an optimal program. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<p>While we are still very much in the early days, neural-backed generators are an extremely promising step toward practical program synthesis. Note that while researchers at RISELab have initially focused on pandas, the techniques and tools behind AutoPandas can be applied to other APIs (e.g., numpy, TensorFlow, etc.). So, any number of popular tools used by developers, data scientists, or data engineers can benefit from some level of automation via program synthesis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programming tools have always changed over time (I no longer use Perl, for example), and there has always been an expectation that technologists should be able to adapt to the latest tools and methods. Continued progress in tools for program synthesis means that automation will change how data scientists, data engineers, or developers do their work. One can imagine a future where mastery of individual tools and APIs will matter less, and technologists can focus on architecture and building end-to-end systems and applications. As tools and APIs get easier to use, your employer won\'t care as much about what tools you know coming into a job, but they will expect you to <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/making-data-science-useful"">possess ""soft skills"" (including skills that cannot be easily automated)</a>, domain knowledge and expertise, and the ability to think holistically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<a href=""https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77026""><em>Building reinforcement learning models and AI applications with Ray</em></a>: a tutorial at the Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Jose, September 9-12, 2019.</li>\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp"">“AI Adoption in the Enterprise”</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">“Deep automation in machine learning”</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-improving-customer-experience"">“How AI and machine learning are improving customer experience”</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development"">“What machine learning means for software development”</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray"">“The evolution and expanding utility of Ray”</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-machine-learning-will-require-retraining-your-entire-organization"">“AI and machine learning will require retraining your entire organization”</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development\'>RISELab’s AutoPandas hints at automation tech that will change the nature of software development.</a></p><img src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/5zO30jAXZME"" height=""1"" width=""1"" alt=""""/>'}]",https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development,True,"tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-07-01:/ideas/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/5zO30jAXZME/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development,"[{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/5zO30jAXZME/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}]","<p><img src='https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/drum_of_a_washing_machine_crop-6f4d097fc5199bef6313bcbd616fd6ba.jpg'/></p><p><em>Neural-backed generators are a promising step toward practical program synthesis.</em></p><p>There's a lot of hype surrounding AI, but are companies actually beginning to use AI technologies?

<p>One area I’m particularly interested in is the application of AI and automation technologies in data science, data engineering, and software development. <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development"">We’ve sketched some initial manifestations</a> of “human in the loop” technologies in software development, where initial applications of machine learning are beginning to change how people build and manage software systems. Automation has also emerged as one of the hottest topics in data science and machine learning (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning"">AutoML</a>), and teams of researchers and practitioners are actively building tools that can <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">automate every stage of a machine learning pipeline</a>.</p>



<p>For a typical data scientist, data engineer, or developer, there is an explosion of tools and APIs they now need to work with and “master.” A data scientist might need to know Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, one or more deep learning frameworks, Apache Spark, and more. <a href=""https://www.dev-diaries.com/blog/im-just-good-at-googling-things/"">According to a recent blog post by Khaliq Gant</a>, a web developer is typically expected to demonstrate competence in things like ""navigating the terminal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cloud infrastructure, deployment strategies, databases, HTTP protocols, and that’s just the beginning."" Data engineers additionally need to master several pieces of infrastructure.</p>

<p>How do data scientists, data engineers, and developers cope with this explosion of tools and APIs? They typically use <em>search</em> (Google) or post in <em>forums</em> (Stack Overflow, Slack, mailing lists). In both instances, it takes some baseline knowledge to both frame a question and to be able to discern which answer is the ""best one"" to choose. In the case of forums, there might be a significant delay before one obtains an adequate response. Those with more resources and more time to spare can avail of free or paid learning resources such as books, videos, or training courses.</p>



<p>There are emerging automation tools that can drastically increase the efficiency and productivity of software developers. At his recent <a href=""https://ai.oreilly.com.cn/ai-cn/public/schedule/detail/76617?locale=en"">keynote</a> at the <a href=""https://ai.oreilly.com.cn/ai-cn?locale=en"">Artificial Intelligence conference in Beijing</a>, professor Ion Stoica, director of <a href=""https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/"">UC Berkeley’s RISELab</a>, unveiled a new research project that hints at a path forward for software developers. Their initial output is <a href=""http://AutoPandas.io"">AutoPandas</a>, a <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf"">program synthesis</a> engine for <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/"">Pandas</a>, one of the most widely used data science libraries today. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf"">As described in a paper from Microsoft and the University of Washington</a>, program synthesis is a longstanding research area in computer science:</p>



<blockquote><p>Program synthesis is the task of automatically finding a program in the underlying programming language that satisfies the user intent expressed in the form of some specification. Since the inception of AI in the 1950s, this problem has been considered the holy grail of computer science.</p></blockquote>



<p>An AutoPandas user simply specifies an input and output data structure (i.e., dataframes), and AutoPandas automatically synthesizes an optimal program that produces the desired output from the given input. AutoPandas relies on ""program generators"" that capture the API constraints to reduce the search space (the space of possible programs is immense), neural network models to predict the arguments of the API calls, and the distributed computing framework <a href=""https://github.com/ray-project/ray"">Ray</a> to scale up the search.</p>

<figure class=""center"" id=""id-RBQi8""><img alt=""An AutoPandas user specifies an input and output data structure, and neural-backed generators output an optimal program"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-1904491123bb816831a7e8a737627c0c.png""><figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 3. </span>An AutoPandas user specifies an input and output data structure, and neural-backed generators output an optimal program. Image by Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>


<p>While we are still very much in the early days, neural-backed generators are an extremely promising step toward practical program synthesis. Note that while researchers at RISELab have initially focused on pandas, the techniques and tools behind AutoPandas can be applied to other APIs (e.g., numpy, TensorFlow, etc.). So, any number of popular tools used by developers, data scientists, or data engineers can benefit from some level of automation via program synthesis.</p>



<p>Programming tools have always changed over time (I no longer use Perl, for example), and there has always been an expectation that technologists should be able to adapt to the latest tools and methods. Continued progress in tools for program synthesis means that automation will change how data scientists, data engineers, or developers do their work. One can imagine a future where mastery of individual tools and APIs will matter less, and technologists can focus on architecture and building end-to-end systems and applications. As tools and APIs get easier to use, your employer won't care as much about what tools you know coming into a job, but they will expect you to <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/making-data-science-useful"">possess ""soft skills"" (including skills that cannot be easily automated)</a>, domain knowledge and expertise, and the ability to think holistically.</p>

A team from <a href=""https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/"">RISE Lab</a> will teach <a href=""https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77026"">an updated tutorial on Ray</a>, an open source distributed computing framework that includes a popular library for RL (<a href=""https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html"">RLlib</a>). As I noted in a <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-adoption-is-being-fueled-by-an-improved-tool-ecosystem"">recent post</a>, Ray continues to <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray"">grow impressively along multiple fronts</a>, including number of users, contributors, and libraries.</li>

<p>AI and ML are going to impact and permeate most aspects of a company’s operations, products, and services. To succeed in implementing and incorporating AI and machine learning technologies, companies need to take a more holistic approach toward retraining their workforces. This will be an ongoing endeavor as research results continue to be translated into practical systems that companies can use. Individuals will need to continue to learn new skills as technologies continue to evolve and because many areas of AI and ML are increasingly becoming democratized.</p>

These ML development tools are designed specifically to help teams of developers, <a href=""https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2019/03/28/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/"">machine learning engineers</a>, and data scientists collaborate, manage, and <em>reproduce</em>, ML experiments. Many tools in this category let users to systematically conduct modeling experiments (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UADvHfcMJek"">NAS</a>) while emphasizing the ease with which one can manage, track, and reproduce such experiments.</p>\n\n<h2>Model governance</h2>\n\n<p>We are also beginning to come across companies that acknowledge the need for model <em>governance</em> tools and capabilities. Just as companies have long treated data as assets, as ML becomes more central to an organization’s operations, models will be treated as important assets. More precisely, models built or tuned for specific applications (in reality, this means <em>models + data</em>) <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential"">will need to be managed and protected</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>\n\t<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>\n\t<li>A catalog of validation data sets and the accuracy measurements of stored models</li>\n\t<li>Versioning (of models, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)"">feature vectors</a>, data) and the ability to roll out, roll back, or have multiple live versions</li>\n\t<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for a full audit trail</li>\n\t<li>Who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>\n\t<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Model operations, testing, and monitoring</h2>\n\n<p>As machine learning proliferates in products and services, we need a set of roles, best practices, and tools to deploy, manage, test, and monitor ML in real-world production settings. There are some initial tools aimed at model operations and testing—mainly for deploying and <a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441"">monitoring ML</a><a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441""> models</a>—but it’s clear we are still in the early stages for solutions in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>There are three <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services"">common issues that diminish the value of ML models</a> once they’re in production. The first is <em>concept drift</em>: the accuracy of models in production degrades over time, because of changes in the real world, stemming from a growing disparity between the data they were trained on and the data they are used on. The second is <em>locality</em>: when deploying models to new geographic locations, user demographics, or business customers, it’s often not the case that pre-trained models work at the expected level of accuracy. Measuring online accuracy per customer / geography / demographic group is important both to monitor bias and to ensure accuracy for a growing customer base. The third is <em>data quality</em>: since ML models are more sensitive to the semantics of incoming data, changes in data distribution that are often missed by traditional data quality tools wreak havoc on models’ accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the need to monitor that your current deployed models operate as intended, another challenge is knowing that a newly proposed model actually delivers better performance in production. Some <a href=""https://www.datatron.com/"">early systems</a> allow for the comparison of an “incumbent model” against “challenger models,” including having challengers in “dark launch” or “offline” mode (this means challenger models are evaluated on production traffic but haven’t been deployed to production). Other noteworthy items include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tools for continuous integration and continuous testing of models. A model is not “correct” if it returns a valid value—it has to meet an accuracy bar. There needs to be a way to validate this against a given metric and validation set before deploying a model.</li>\n\t<li>Online measurement of the accuracy of each model (what’s the accuracy that users are experiencing “in the field”?). Related to this is the need to monitor bias, locality effects, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning"">related risks</a>. For example, scores often need to be broken down by demographics (are men and women getting similar accuracy?) or locales (are German and Spanish users getting similar accuracy?).</li>\n\t<li>The ability to manage the quality of service for model inference to different customers, including rate limiting, request size limiting, metering, bot detection, and IP geo-fencing.</li>\n\t<li>Ability to scale (and auto-scale), secure, monitor, and troubleshoot live models. Scaling has two dimensions—the size of the traffic hitting the models and the number of models that need to be evaluated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Model operations and testing is very much still a nascent field where systematic checklists are just beginning to be assembled. An overview from a <a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf"">2017 paper from Google</a> lets us gauge how much tooling is still needed for model operations and testing. This paper came with a <em>28-item checklist</em> that detailed things that need to be accounted for in order to have a reliable, production-grade machine learning system:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Features and data</strong>: seven items that include checks for privacy controls, feature validation, exploring the necessity and cost of a feature, and other data-related tests.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Tests for model development</strong>: seven sanity checks, including checking whether a simpler model will suffice, model performance on critical data slices (e.g., region, age, recency, frequency, etc.), the impact of model staleness, and other important considerations.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Infrastructure tests</strong>: a suite of seven considerations, including the reproducibility of model training, the ease with which models can be rolled back, integration tests on end-to-end model pipelines, model tests via a <a href=""https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/canary-canary-testing"">canary process</a>.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Monitoring</strong>: the authors list a series of seven items to ensure models are working as expected. This includes tests for <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services"">model staleness</a>, performance metrics (training, inference, throughput), validating that training and serving code generate similar values, and other essential items.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>New roles</h2>\n\n<p>Discussions around machine learning tend to revolve around the work of data scientists and model building experts. This is beginning to change now that many companies are entering the implementation phase for their ML initiatives. <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers"">Machine learning engineers</a>, data engineers, developers, and domain experts are critical to the success of ML projects. At the moment, few (if any) teams have checklists as extensive as the one detailed in the <a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf"">2017 paper from Google</a>. The task of building real-world production-grade ML models still requires stitching together tools and teams that cut across many functional areas. However, as tools for model governance and model operations and testing begin to get refined and become more widely available, it’s likely that specialists (an “ML ops team”) will be tasked to use such tools. <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">Automation</a> will also be an important component, as these tools will need to enable organizations to build, manage, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-to-build-machine-learning-tools-to-augment-machine-learning-engineers"">monitor many more machine learning models</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=""center"" id=""id-6LDiA""><img alt=""Demand for tools for managing ML in the enterprise"" src=""https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-c9a455c660bff61358774ec606b9b739.png"">\n<figcaption><span class=""label"">Figure 2. </span>Demand for tools for managing ML in the enterprise.

There are also new tools that cover aspects of governance, production deployment, serving, and monitoring, but at the moment they tend to focus on single ML libraries (<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx"">TFX</a>) or modeling tools (<a href=""https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/model-manager.html"">SAS Model Manager</a>). The reality is, enterprises will want flexibility in the libraries, modeling tools, and environments they use.

	<li>Unlike traditional software where the goal is to meet a functional specification, in ML the goal is to optimize a metric.</li>
	<li>Quality depends not just on code, but also on data, tuning, regular updates, and retraining.</li>
	<li>Those involved with ML usually want to experiment with new libraries, algorithms, and data sources—and thus, one must be able to put those new components into production.</li>

	<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>
	<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>
	<li>A catalog of validation data sets and the accuracy measurements of stored models</li>
	<li>Versioning (of models, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)"">feature vectors</a>, data) and the ability to roll out, roll back, or have multiple live versions</li>
	<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for a full audit trail</li>
	<li>Who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>
	<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model operations, testing, and monitoring</h2>

<p>As machine learning proliferates in products and services, we need a set of roles, best practices, and tools to deploy, manage, test, and monitor ML in real-world production settings. There are some initial tools aimed at model operations and testing—mainly for deploying and <a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441"">monitoring ML</a><a href=""https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441""> models</a>—but it’s clear we are still in the early stages for solutions in these areas.</p>

<p>There are three <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services"">common issues that diminish the value of ML models</a> once they’re in production. The first is <em>concept drift</em>: the accuracy of models in production degrades over time, because of changes in the real world, stemming from a growing disparity between the data they were trained on and the data they are used on. The second is <em>locality</em>: when deploying models to new geographic locations, user demographics, or business customers, it’s often not the case that pre-trained models work at the expected level of accuracy. Measuring online accuracy per customer / geography / demographic group is important both to monitor bias and to ensure accuracy for a growing customer base. The third is <em>data quality</em>: since ML models are more sensitive to the semantics of incoming data, changes in data distribution that are often missed by traditional data quality tools wreak havoc on models’ accuracy.</p>

<p>Beyond the need to monitor that your current deployed models operate as intended, another challenge is knowing that a newly proposed model actually delivers better performance in production. Some <a href=""https://www.datatron.com/"">early systems</a> allow for the comparison of an “incumbent model” against “challenger models,” including having challengers in “dark launch” or “offline” mode (this means challenger models are evaluated on production traffic but haven’t been deployed to production). Other noteworthy items include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tools for continuous integration and continuous testing of models. A model is not “correct” if it returns a valid value—it has to meet an accuracy bar. There needs to be a way to validate this against a given metric and validation set before deploying a model.</li>
	<li>Online measurement of the accuracy of each model (what’s the accuracy that users are experiencing “in the field”?). Related to this is the need to monitor bias, locality effects, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning"">related risks</a>. For example, scores often need to be broken down by demographics (are men and women getting similar accuracy?) or locales (are German and Spanish users getting similar accuracy?).</li>
	<li>The ability to manage the quality of service for model inference to different customers, including rate limiting, request size limiting, metering, bot detection, and IP geo-fencing.</li>
	<li>Ability to scale (and auto-scale), secure, monitor, and troubleshoot live models. Scaling has two dimensions—the size of the traffic hitting the models and the number of models that need to be evaluated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Model operations and testing is very much still a nascent field where systematic checklists are just beginning to be assembled. An overview from a <a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf"">2017 paper from Google</a> lets us gauge how much tooling is still needed for model operations and testing. This paper came with a <em>28-item checklist</em> that detailed things that need to be accounted for in order to have a reliable, production-grade machine learning system:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<strong>Features and data</strong>: seven items that include checks for privacy controls, feature validation, exploring the necessity and cost of a feature, and other data-related tests.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Tests for model development</strong>: seven sanity checks, including checking whether a simpler model will suffice, model performance on critical data slices (e.g., region, age, recency, frequency, etc.), the impact of model staleness, and other important considerations.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Infrastructure tests</strong>: a suite of seven considerations, including the reproducibility of model training, the ease with which models can be rolled back, integration tests on end-to-end model pipelines, model tests via a <a href=""https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/canary-canary-testing"">canary process</a>.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Monitoring</strong>: the authors list a series of seven items to ensure models are working as expected. This includes tests for <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services"">model staleness</a>, performance metrics (training, inference, throughput), validating that training and serving code generate similar values, and other essential items.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New roles</h2>

<p>Discussions around machine learning tend to revolve around the work of data scientists and model building experts. This is beginning to change now that many companies are entering the implementation phase for their ML initiatives. <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers"">Machine learning engineers</a>, data engineers, developers, and domain experts are critical to the success of ML projects. At the moment, few (if any) teams have checklists as extensive as the one detailed in the <a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf"">2017 paper from Google</a>. The task of building real-world production-grade ML models still requires stitching together tools and teams that cut across many functional areas. However, as tools for model governance and model operations and testing begin to get refined and become more widely available, it’s likely that specialists (an “ML ops team”) will be tasked to use such tools. <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning"">Automation</a> will also be an important component, as these tools will need to enable organizations to build, manage, and <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-to-build-machine-learning-tools-to-augment-machine-learning-engineers"">monitor many more machine learning models</a>.</p>

<p>We are beginning to see specialized tools that allow <a href=""https://determined.ai/blog/announcing-the-future-of-ai-infrastructure/"">teams</a> to manage the ML model development lifecycle. Tools like MLflow are being used to track and manage machine learning experiments (mainly offline, using test data). There are also new tools that cover aspects of governance, production deployment, serving, and monitoring, but at the moment they tend to focus on single ML libraries (<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx"">TFX</a>) or modeling tools (<a href=""https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/model-manager.html"">SAS Model Manager</a>). The reality is, enterprises will want flexibility in the libraries, modeling tools, and environments they use. Fortunately, startups and companies are beginning to build comprehensive tools for enabling ML in the enterprise.</p>

We see two main classes of problems, which have varying degrees of complexity, and often mandate different approaches and tools to solve them. Since they consume <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#67adc2386f63"">a significant amount of time spent</a> on most data science projects, we highlight these two main classes of data quality problems in this post:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Data unification and integration</li>\r\n\t<li>Error detection and automatic repairing/imputation</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Data unification and integration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the rise of open source tools for large-scale ingestion, messaging, queuing, and stream processing, siloed data and data sets trapped behind the bars of various business units is the normal state of affairs in any large enterprise. Data unification or integration refers to the set of activities that bring this data together into one unified data context. Schema matching and mapping, record linkage and deduplication, and various mastering activities are the types of tasks a data integration solution performs. Advances in ML offer a scalable and efficient way to replace legacy top-down, rule-based systems, which often result in massive costs and very low success in today’s big data settings. Bottom-up solutions with human-guided ML pipelines (such as Tamr, Paxata, or Informatica—<em>full disclosure: Ihab Ilyas is co-founder of Tamr</em>) show how to leverage the available rules and human expertise to train scalable integration models that work on thousands of sources and large volumes of data. We discussed some of the challenges and enablers in using ML for this class of problems in an earlier <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale"">post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The class of data unification problems has its own characteristics in terms of solution complexity: (1) the problem is often quadratic in the size of the input (since we need to compare everything to everything else), and (2) the main ML task is fairly understood and is mainly determining if two “things” are the same. These characteristics have a considerable impact on the design of the solution. For example, a complex sophisticated model for finding duplicates or matching schema is the least of our worries if we cannot even enumerate all possible pairs that need to be checked. Effective solutions for data unification problems tend to be a serious engineering effort to: (1) prune the space of possible candidates; (2) interact effectively with experts to provide training data and validate the machine decision; and (3) keep rich lineage and provenance to track decisions back for auditing, revising, or reusing for future use cases. Due to the nature of the ML task (mainly Boolean classification here), and the richness of structure, most successful models tend to be the good old “shallow” models, such as random forest, with the help of simple language models (to help with strings data). See this article on <a href=""https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ilyas/papers/StonebrakerIEEE2018.pdf"">data integration status</a> for details.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Error detection, repairing and value imputation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Siloed or integrated data is often noisy, missing, and sometimes even has contradicting facts. <em>Data cleaning</em> is the class of data quality efforts that focuses on spotting and (hopefully) repairing such errors. Like data integration, data cleaning exercises often have been carried out with intensive labor work, or ad-hoc rule-based point solutions. However, this class has different complexities and characteristics that affect the design of the solution: the core ML task is often far more complex than a matching task, and requires building models that understand “how data was generated” and “how errors were introduced” to be able to reverse that process to spot and repair errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While data cleaning has long been a research topic in academia, it often has been looked at as a theoretical logic problem. This probably explains why none of the solutions have been adopted in industry. The good news is that researchers from academia recently managed to leverage that large body of work and combine it with the power of scalable statistical inference for data cleaning. The open source <a href=""http://www.holoclean.io"">HoloClean</a> probabilistic cleaning framework is currently the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03402"">state-of-the-art system</a> for ML-based automatic error detection and repair. HoloClean adopts the well-known <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_channel_model"">“noisy channel”</a> model to explain how data was generated and how it was “polluted.” It then leverages all known domain knowledge (such as available rules), statistical information in the data, and available trusted sources to build complex data generation and error models. The models are then used to spot errors and suggest the “most probable” values to replace.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Paying attention to scale is a requirement cleaning and integration have in common: building such complex models involves “featurizing” the whole data set via a series of operations—for example, to compute violations of rules, count co-occurrences, or build language models. Hence, an ML cleaning solution would need to be innovative on how to avoid the complexity of these operations. HoloClean, for example uses techniques to prune the domain of database cell and apply judicious relaxations to the underlying model to achieve the required scalability. Older research tools struggled with how to handle the various types of errors, and how to combine the heterogeneous quality input (e.g., business and quality rules, policies, statistical signals in the data, etc.). The HoloClean framework advances the state of the art in two fundamental ways: (1) combining the logical rules and the statistical distribution of the data into one coherent probabilistic model; and (2) scaling the learning and inference process via a series of system and model optimizations, which allowed it to be deployed in census organizations and large commercial enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Data programming</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Increasing the quality of the available data via either unification or cleaning, or both, is definitely an important and a promising way forward to leverage enterprise data assets. However, the quest for <em>more</em> data is not over, for two main reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>ML models for cleaning and unification often need training data and examples of possible errors or matching records. Depending completely on human labeling for these examples is simply a non-starter; as ML models get more complex and the underlying data sources get larger, the need for more data increases, the scale of which cannot be achieved by human experts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Even if we boosted the quality of the available data via unification and cleaning, it still might not be enough to power the even more complex analytics and predictions models (often built as a deep learning model).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>An important paradigm for solving both these problems is the concept of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723"">data programming</a>. In a nutshell, data programming techniques provide ways to “manufacture” data that we can feed to various learning and predictions tasks (even for ML data quality solutions). In practical terms, “data programming” unifies a class of techniques used for the programmatic creation of training data sets. In this category of tools, frameworks like <a href=""https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/"">Snorkel</a> show how to allow developers and data scientists to focus on writing labeling functions to programmatically label data, and then model the noise in the labels to effectively train high-quality models. While using data programming to train high-quality analytics models might be clear, we find it interesting how it is used internally in ML models for the data unification and cleaning we mentioned earlier in this post. For example, tools like <a href=""http://www.tamr.com"">Tamr</a> leverage legacy rules written by customers to generate a large amount of (programmatically) labeled data to power its matching ML pipeline. In a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02285"">recent paper,</a> the HoloClean project showed how to use “data augmentation” to generate many examples of possible errors (from a small seed) to power its automatic error detection model.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Market validation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The landscape of solutions we presented here for the quest for high-quality data have already been well validated in the market today.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ML solutions for data unification such as Tamr and Informatica have been deployed at a large number of Fortune-1000 enterprises.</li>\r\n\t<li>Automatic data cleaning solutions such as HoloClean already have been deployed by multiple financial services and the census bureaus of various countries.</li>\r\n\t<li>As the growing <a href=""https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/"">list of Snorkel users</a> suggests, data programming solutions are beginning to change the way data scientists provision ML models.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we get more mature in understanding the differences between the various problems of integration, cleaning, and automatic data generation, we will see real improvement in handling the valuable data assets in the enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Machine learning applications rely on three main components: models, data, and compute. A lot of articles are written about new breakthrough models, many of which are created by researchers who publish not only papers, but code written in popular open source libraries. In addition, recent advances in automated machine learning has resulted in many tools that can (partially) automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Thus, many cutting-edge models are now available to data scientists. Similarly, cloud platforms have made compute and hardware more accessible to developers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Models are increasingly becoming commodities. As we noted in the survey results above, the reality is that a lack of high-quality training data remains the main bottleneck in most machine learning projects. We believe that machine learning engineers and data scientists will continue to spend most of their time creating and refining training data. Fortunately, help is on the way: as we’ve described in this post, we are finally beginning to see a class of technologies aimed squarely at the need for quality training data.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale"">“Three enablers for machine learning in data unification: Trust, legacy, and scale”</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel"">“Software 2.0 and Snorkel”</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Ihab Ilyas on <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-data-preparation-frameworks-rely-on-human-in-the-loop-systems"">“Why data preparation frameworks rely on human-in-the-loop systems”</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>Alex Ratner on <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/creating-large-training-data-sets-quickly"">“Creating large training data sets quickly”</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>Jeff Jonas on <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/real-time-entity-resolution-made-accessible"">“Real-time entity resolution made accessible”</a>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning"">“Data collection and data markets in the age of privacy and machine learning”</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\'>The quest for high-quality data.</a></p><img src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/geym9vzewXA"" height=""1"" width=""1"" alt=""""/>'}]",https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data,True,"tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-06-18:/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/geym9vzewXA/the-quest-for-high-quality-data,"[{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/geym9vzewXA/the-quest-for-high-quality-data', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}]","<p><img src='https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/lunette-dobservation_crop-acf3baee4bef7e292e8a272afa93087d.jpg'/></p><p><em>Machine learning solutions for data integration, cleaning, and data generation are beginning to emerge.</em></p><p>“AI starts with ‘good’ data” is a statement that receives wide agreement from data scientists, analysts, and business owners.

<h3>Data unification and integration</h3>

<p>Even with the rise of open source tools for large-scale ingestion, messaging, queuing, and stream processing, siloed data and data sets trapped behind the bars of various business units is the normal state of affairs in any large enterprise. Data unification or integration refers to the set of activities that bring this data together into one unified data context. Schema matching and mapping, record linkage and deduplication, and various mastering activities are the types of tasks a data integration solution performs. Advances in ML offer a scalable and efficient way to replace legacy top-down, rule-based systems, which often result in massive costs and very low success in today’s big data settings. Bottom-up solutions with human-guided ML pipelines (such as Tamr, Paxata, or Informatica—<em>full disclosure: Ihab Ilyas is co-founder of Tamr</em>) show how to leverage the available rules and human expertise to train scalable integration models that work on thousands of sources and large volumes of data. We discussed some of the challenges and enablers in using ML for this class of problems in an earlier <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale"">post</a>.</p>

<p>The class of data unification problems has its own characteristics in terms of solution complexity: (1) the problem is often quadratic in the size of the input (since we need to compare everything to everything else), and (2) the main ML task is fairly understood and is mainly determining if two “things” are the same. These characteristics have a considerable impact on the design of the solution. For example, a complex sophisticated model for finding duplicates or matching schema is the least of our worries if we cannot even enumerate all possible pairs that need to be checked. Effective solutions for data unification problems tend to be a serious engineering effort to: (1) prune the space of possible candidates; (2) interact effectively with experts to provide training data and validate the machine decision; and (3) keep rich lineage and provenance to track decisions back for auditing, revising, or reusing for future use cases. Due to the nature of the ML task (mainly Boolean classification here), and the richness of structure, most successful models tend to be the good old “shallow” models, such as random forest, with the help of simple language models (to help with strings data). See this article on <a href=""https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ilyas/papers/StonebrakerIEEE2018.pdf"">data integration status</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Error detection, repairing and value imputation</h3>

<p>Siloed or integrated data is often noisy, missing, and sometimes even has contradicting facts. <em>Data cleaning</em> is the class of data quality efforts that focuses on spotting and (hopefully) repairing such errors. Like data integration, data cleaning exercises often have been carried out with intensive labor work, or ad-hoc rule-based point solutions. However, this class has different complexities and characteristics that affect the design of the solution: the core ML task is often far more complex than a matching task, and requires building models that understand “how data was generated” and “how errors were introduced” to be able to reverse that process to spot and repair errors.</p>

<p>While data cleaning has long been a research topic in academia, it often has been looked at as a theoretical logic problem. This probably explains why none of the solutions have been adopted in industry. The good news is that researchers from academia recently managed to leverage that large body of work and combine it with the power of scalable statistical inference for data cleaning. The open source <a href=""http://www.holoclean.io"">HoloClean</a> probabilistic cleaning framework is currently the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03402"">state-of-the-art system</a> for ML-based automatic error detection and repair. HoloClean adopts the well-known <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_channel_model"">“noisy channel”</a> model to explain how data was generated and how it was “polluted.” It then leverages all known domain knowledge (such as available rules), statistical information in the data, and available trusted sources to build complex data generation and error models. The models are then used to spot errors and suggest the “most probable” values to replace.</p> 

<p>Paying attention to scale is a requirement cleaning and integration have in common: building such complex models involves “featurizing” the whole data set via a series of operations—for example, to compute violations of rules, count co-occurrences, or build language models. Hence, an ML cleaning solution would need to be innovative on how to avoid the complexity of these operations. HoloClean, for example uses techniques to prune the domain of database cell and apply judicious relaxations to the underlying model to achieve the required scalability. Older research tools struggled with how to handle the various types of errors, and how to combine the heterogeneous quality input (e.g., business and quality rules, policies, statistical signals in the data, etc.). The HoloClean framework advances the state of the art in two fundamental ways: (1) combining the logical rules and the statistical distribution of the data into one coherent probabilistic model; and (2) scaling the learning and inference process via a series of system and model optimizations, which allowed it to be deployed in census organizations and large commercial enterprises.</p>



<h2>Data programming</h2>

<p>Increasing the quality of the available data via either unification or cleaning, or both, is definitely an important and a promising way forward to leverage enterprise data assets. However, the quest for <em>more</em> data is not over, for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>ML models for cleaning and unification often need training data and examples of possible errors or matching records. Depending completely on human labeling for these examples is simply a non-starter; as ML models get more complex and the underlying data sources get larger, the need for more data increases, the scale of which cannot be achieved by human experts.</li>
	<li>Even if we boosted the quality of the available data via unification and cleaning, it still might not be enough to power the even more complex analytics and predictions models (often built as a deep learning model).</li>
</ol>

<p>An important paradigm for solving both these problems is the concept of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723"">data programming</a>. In a nutshell, data programming techniques provide ways to “manufacture” data that we can feed to various learning and predictions tasks (even for ML data quality solutions). In practical terms, “data programming” unifies a class of techniques used for the programmatic creation of training data sets. In this category of tools, frameworks like <a href=""https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/"">Snorkel</a> show how to allow developers and data scientists to focus on writing labeling functions to programmatically label data, and then model the noise in the labels to effectively train high-quality models. While using data programming to train high-quality analytics models might be clear, we find it interesting how it is used internally in ML models for the data unification and cleaning we mentioned earlier in this post. For example, tools like <a href=""http://www.tamr.com"">Tamr</a> leverage legacy rules written by customers to generate a large amount of (programmatically) labeled data to power its matching ML pipeline. In a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02285"">recent paper,</a> the HoloClean project showed how to use “data augmentation” to generate many examples of possible errors (from a small seed) to power its automatic error detection model.</p>

<h2>Market validation</h2>

<p>The landscape of solutions we presented here for the quest for high-quality data have already been well validated in the market today.</p>

<ul>
	<li>ML solutions for data unification such as Tamr and Informatica have been deployed at a large number of Fortune-1000 enterprises.</li>
	<li>Automatic data cleaning solutions such as HoloClean already have been deployed by multiple financial services and the census bureaus of various countries.</li>
	<li>As the growing <a href=""https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/"">list of Snorkel users</a> suggests, data programming solutions are beginning to change the way data scientists provision ML models.</li>
</ul>



<p>As we get more mature in understanding the differences between the various problems of integration, cleaning, and automatic data generation, we will see real improvement in handling the valuable data assets in the enterprise.</p>



<p>Machine learning applications rely on three main components: models, data, and compute. A lot of articles are written about new breakthrough models, many of which are created by researchers who publish not only papers, but code written in popular open source libraries. In addition, recent advances in automated machine learning has resulted in many tools that can (partially) automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Thus, many cutting-edge models are now available to data scientists. Similarly, cloud platforms have made compute and hardware more accessible to developers.</p>



<p>Models are increasingly becoming commodities. As we noted in the survey results above, the reality is that a lack of high-quality training data remains the main bottleneck in most machine learning projects. We believe that machine learning engineers and data scientists will continue to spend most of their time creating and refining training data. Fortunately, help is on the way: as we’ve described in this post, we are finally beginning to see a class of technologies aimed squarely at the need for quality training data.</p>
